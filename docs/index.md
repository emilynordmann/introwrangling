## Statement on use of AI

ChatGPT 4.0 was used to assist in portions of writing this tutorial. Primarily, ChatGPT was used to assist in writing the code to simulate data. Additionally, we used ChatGPT to proof-read and check for typos in code as well as to provide feedback and suggest alternative approaches to coding.
